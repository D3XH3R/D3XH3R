- 👋 Hi, I’m a Frontend dev.
- 👀 I’m interested in building responsive websites with much animation.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning React, and I want to master full-stack development.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on open-source projects 
- 📫 How to reach me: I currently do not have a perfect portfolio website. I built one, but it didn't satisfy me, so I'm going to build one when I finish learning React.
- ⚡ Fun fact: I think I'm going to be the first Full-stack dev in my college :).
